# StrayPups Big Munny $1 — Phase Plan
## Repo: straypups_big_munny_v5_27_PWA
## Source of truth: zip archives. GitHub is behind.

---

## Current Version: v5.54 (cache: spbm-v554)

---

## Repo Overview
Class II bingo PWA. $1 denomination. All wins determined by bingo patterns. Reels are cosmetic. Connects to WABC for wide-area ball call and Progressive for WAP jackpot.

---

## Stack
- ES5 only — no arrow functions, const, let, backticks, async/await
- Supabase: gdmmoeggkqsvqnqyrubx.supabase.co
- Service worker cache: spbm-v551
- Key files: js/game.js, js/progressive.js, js/config.js, js/operator.js, wabc.js, broadcast-init.js
- Root copies of game.js and progressive.js must always stay in sync with js/ versions

---

## Phase History

### v5.40–v5.42 — WABC + Progressive Integration
- WABC.init() wired inside Progressive.init() callback
- Progressive symbol id:7 added to SPIN_SYM_IDS and VSTOP_TABLE (weight 500)
- _activeCallNext() stops at ball 75, sets seqExhausted=true
- generateCoverAllSpin() saves/restores usingServerBalls
- Progressive pattern pay:[0,0,0] — showcase shows WIDE AREA PROGRESSIVE
- armAndClaim() rewritten — inserts directly into progressive_commands, uses returned ID
- winPatterns sort — progressive pattern sorted LAST (pay:[0,0,0] would break basePat)
- rsPatterns filters out progressive pattern (handled separately, not run through Red Spin)

### v5.43 — Bug Fix Pass
- doBingoSpin: stop overwriting player ballPos from WABC.getBallPos()
- generateCoverAllSpin: restore usingServerBalls after call
- armAndClaim: rewritten to insert directly and use returned command ID (no Realtime timing dependency)
- Progressive pattern sorted to last position — basePat always lowest non-progressive pattern
- rsPatterns excludes progressive pattern from Red Spin

### v5.44 — Class II Reel Fix (REVERTED in v5.47)
- Removed evalSpin rejection loop — WRONG, caused cherries to show on losing spins

### v5.45 — Floor Manager Integration
- _writeGameHistory() added — writes every SPIN/CASH_IN/CASH_OUT to game_history table
- window._floorSupabaseClient exposed by progressive.js
- isProgressive and progAmount added to progressive jackpot opLog calls

### v5.46 — evalSpin Restored
- evalSpin rejection loop restored for no-bingo spins (Class II: visual must not contradict bingo result)
- Cherries on any reel rejected on no-bingo spins
- Wild+blank reordered correctly

### v5.47 — evalSpin Corrected
- Any wild (Scott id:0 or Progressive id:7) on payline always rejected on no-bingo spins
- 2x Progressive combos only appear via forcedSpinResult on bingo wins
- Scott+Progressive combo also correctly rejected

### v5.48 — WABC Channel Exposure (REVERTED in v5.50)
- WRONG: attempted to broadcast ball position — reverted

### v5.49 — Sequence Exhaustion (REVERTED in v5.50)
- WRONG architecture — reverted

### v5.50 — Correct Sequence Architecture
- updateBallPos() confirmed no-op — ball position per-player local only, never broadcast
- _requestNewWABCSequence() added — called when ball 75 hit OR Cover All occurs
- Calls upsert_ball_call RPC + broadcasts new_call to all players via wabc-ballpos channel
- wabc.js exposes window._wabcChannel after init for _requestNewWABCSequence to use

### v5.51 — Auto Sequence Renewal
- _activeCallNext() now calls _requestNewWABCSequence() immediately at ball 75
- New sequence broadcasting before player even presses spin
- doBingoSpin simplified — reads WABC.getSequence(), fallback _requestNewWABCSequence if still exhausted
- All root file copies synced (game.js, progressive.js, sw.js)
- Cache bust: spbm-v551

---

## Pending
- [ ] Player nickname device-to-device travel (via player_registry)
- [ ] Balance persistence across sessions
- [ ] game_history writes verified end-to-end with Floor Manager
- [ ] Full jackpot flow test: natural Cover All → armAndClaim → showProgJP → all patterns pay → Red Spin
- [ ] Connected players showing in Progressive Operator and WABC tool

---

## Rules
- Never modify RTP/math without Monte Carlo verification
- ES5 only throughout
- Version bumps: 0.1 per delivery
- Root copies of game.js and progressive.js must always match js/ versions
- Cache bust on every single build — no exceptions

### v5.52 — Duplicate WABC Channels Fix
- progressive.js now sets window._wabcSupabaseClient = _client
- wabc.js was looking for this but progressive.js only set _floorSupabaseClient
- Without it each game created its own Supabase client and wabc-ballpos channel
- This caused 4 separate WABC channels instead of 1 shared channel
- Cache bust: spbm-v552

### v5.53 — progressive_hits Insert Fix
- Added 500ms delay before progressive_hits insert after progressive_hit RPC
- RPC and insert were firing back-to-back causing silent insert failures
- Added .then() error logging for both _claimForceWin and hit() paths
- Cache bust: spbm-v553

### v5.54 — Presence Rate Limit Fix (CRITICAL)
- updateLastSpin() was calling _presenceChannel.track() on EVERY spin
- This caused ClientPresenceRateLimitReached errors flooding Supabase
- Rate limit terminated entire Realtime tenant — killed ALL tool connections
- Fixed: track() now throttled to max once per 30 seconds
- Last spin time stored locally on every spin, only broadcast every 30s
- Cache bust: spbm-v554

---

## Current Version: v5.54 (cache: spbm-v554)

## Pending
- [ ] Confirm operator tools connect after presence throttle fix
- [ ] Confirm single wabc-ballpos channel (not 4)
- [ ] progressive_hits records writing correctly
- [ ] Full jackpot flow end-to-end test
- [ ] Neon.tech migration planning

### v5.56 — Jackpot Card Generation Fix
- generateCoverAllSpin() rebuilt — now uses actual WABC sequence
- Builds special card from first 25 balls of BG.callSeq respecting column constraints
- B=1-15, I=16-30, N=31-45, G=46-60, O=61-75
- Cell 12 (free space) always null and always pre-daubed
- usingServerBalls stays true throughout — LIVE badge never changes
- Cover All triggers _requestNewWABCSequence for fresh sequence
- Removed unnecessary usingServerBalls save/restore
- Cache bust: spbm-v556

### v5.57 — CRITICAL: Legacy JWT Anon Key Fix
- sb_publishable_ key silently ignored by Supabase Realtime WebSocket server
- This broke ALL Realtime features: presence, broadcast, postgres_changes
- Symptoms: 0 players in operator, WABC not connecting, jackpot not detected
- Fixed: replaced sb_publishable_ with legacy eyJ... JWT anon key everywhere
- Cache bust: spbm-v557

### v5.58 — Force Jackpot Toast/Lockup/Notify Fixes
- onForceNotify/onForceWin converted to multi-listener arrays (were single-callback, getting overwritten)
- winner_game now mapped through PROG_GAME_TITLES (was showing raw game_id like 'straypups_1d')
- Fixed duplicate id="ac-amt"/"ac-jackpot-amt" on attitude-check overlay
- Added ac-game element showing which game won
- Force jackpot card generation wrapped in try/catch with fallback (prevents lockup if generateCoverAllSpin throws)
- Added 15s spin watchdog — force-unlocks game if spin never completes (DB hang, exception, etc.)
- Cache bust: spbm-v558

### v5.59 — CDC Connection Pool Exhaustion Fix
- prog-commands-XXXX (unique per-session channel) caused
  PoolingReplicationPreparationError: queue_timeout after 11+ seconds
- Each test reload created a new CDC replication slot subscription,
  exhausting the free tier's Realtime connection pool
- Fixed: shared 'prog-commands' channel name for all sessions
- Client-side filtering (winner_session !== _sessionKey) unchanged — still correct
- Cache bust: spbm-v559

### v5.60 — Mid-Sequence Join Sync (Ball Position)
- Joining players always started at ball 40 regardless of live caller's actual position
- ball_pos in DB is intentionally never updated (CDC pool protection from v5.39)
- Fixed via broadcast handshake on wabc-ballpos channel (zero DB writes):
  - New player sends 'sync_request' on join
  - Actively-calling player (BG.entTimer running) responds with 'sync_response' { pos }
  - New player fast-forwards card/strip/matchedCells to that position
  - If pos >= 40, joining player also starts their own active caller
- wabc.js: added setPosProvider(), onSyncResponse(), sync_request/sync_response handlers
- Cache bust: spbm-v560

### v5.61 — Jackpot Card Redesign + Duplicate Notification Fix
- generateCoverAllSpin() redesigned per Sasha's spec:
  - Pool is now first 40 balls (pre-called zone), not first 25
  - Picks 25 cells from this 40-ball pool respecting column constraints
  - 40-ball pool guarantees enough numbers per column (avg 8 vs 4-5 needed)
    -> eliminates the "not enough numbers" fallback bug from v5.56-v5.60
  - ALL 25 cells guaranteed daubed (within pre-called zone = already called)
  - BG.ballPos=40 (matches normal pre-called convention, was 25)
  - Natural-feeling: looks like a real Cover All within the pre-called zone
- Fixed duplicate "Attitude Check" popup for other players on force jackpot:
  - progressive_hits INSERT handler now skips notify when pattern==='Force Jackpot'
  - progressive_commands UPDATE handler already covers that case
- v5d: re-synced stale root game.js (was missing v5.60 sync code, unused
  duplicate — index.html loads from js/game.js, this was cosmetic cleanup)
- Cache bust: spbm-v561

### v5.62 — Cover All 40 / Cover All 75 Patterns Added
- Added 2 missing patterns to BINGO_PATTERNS (config.js):
  - 'Cover All 40' (balls:40, pay:[.01,.01,.01] all bets, reel:null)
    Natural Cover All within pre-called zone (1-40) — awards $0.01, ends sequence
  - 'Cover All 75' (balls:75, pay:[0,0,0], reel:null)
    Natural Cover All in entertainment zone (1-75) — no pay, ends sequence
- doBingoSpin()'s existing per-ball pattern loop picks these up automatically —
  no special-casing needed. If Cover All 25 (Progressive) occurs, Cover All 40
  and Cover All 75 both qualify too (25<=40<=75) -> all three stack/pay together
  per bingo rules, full celebration plays
- generateCoverAllSpin() winPatterns filter updated to include all 3 cover-all
  patterns (was excluding Cover All 75 due to balls<=40 filter)
- rsPatterns (Red Spin animation list) now excludes reel:null patterns —
  Cover All 40/75 have no reel stops per design, but their pay (e.g. $0.01)
  is still included via _allPatsBonus
- Cache bust: spbm-v562

### v5.63 — Cover All 40 Pay Always Credited
- In the non-progressive win branch, Cover All 40's $0.01 (and Cover All 75's
  $0, for symmetry) are now always added to baseAmt if present in winPatterns,
  even when basePat is a different pattern. Previously only paid if it
  happened to be winPatterns[0] (since reel:null excludes it from rsPatterns).
- Cache bust: spbm-v563

### v5.64 — Bug B: Cancel-Jackpot Reset
- _subscribeCommands UPDATE handler now also handles status==='cancelled':
  clears _forceArmed/_forceCommandId/_forceClaimed if matches this game's
  armed command id, so it stops trying to claim a dead command.
- _claimForceWin: when the won-update matches 0 rows (already claimed by
  another player OR cancelled), also clears _forceArmed/_forceCommandId
  (previously only _forceClaimed was reset, causing repeated retry attempts
  on every future spin).
- Cache bust: spbm-v564

### v5.65 — Splash Version Display Fix
- <title> and #splash-ver were hardcoded at "v5.39" for 25 versions —
  never updated despite cache-bust bumps. Now shows v5.65.
- PERMANENT RULE ADDED: every future version bump must also update the
  user-visible version display (splash/title), not just cache-busting.
- Cache bust: spbm-v565

### v5.66 — Progressive Jackpot Sequential Award Flow (Major Restructure)
Per Sasha's spec, the Cover-All-25 award sequence is now correctly ordered:
  1. Cover All 40 ($0.01) — instant toast + penny credited immediately
  2. All other winning patterns (balls<=40), sorted LOWEST pay -> HIGHEST,
     daubed/awarded via Red Spin reel-stacking animation (runRS)
  3. Progressive Jackpot — grand finale celebration (showProgJP)
  4. After celebration dismissed: full-card daub, win logged, sequence ends
     (stopActiveCaller + _requestNewWABCSequence) per Cover-All bingo rule

New function _finishProgressiveSpin() implements steps 1-3 and calls the
rewritten showProgJP() (now finale-only, handles step 4 on dismiss).
Previously showProgJP ran FIRST (celebration before other patterns) and
the ball sequence never ended after a progressive win — both fixed.

_allPatsBonus no longer double-counts Cover All 40 (now handled solely
inside _finishProgressiveSpin).

Applies to BOTH force jackpot and natural Cover-All-25 wins.
Cache bust: spbm-v566

### v5.67 — Progressive Celebration Dismiss-Collision Fix
- When Corporal Stripes ($800, reel:'jp') is the last Red Spin pattern before
  the Progressive finale, the player's tap-to-dismiss on the $800 JACKPOT
  overlay was also instantly dismissing the Progressive overlay that appeared
  right after (residual tap hit both full-screen tap-anywhere overlays).
- Fixed: showProgJP's dismiss handlers now activate only after a 600ms guard
  delay. Added a 300ms pause after the $800 JACKPOT overlay closes before
  continuing to the Progressive finale, so the two celebrations are visually
  distinct moments.
- Confirmed: Red Spin reel symbols correctly escalate low->high (Open Diamond
  cherry first, up through Corporal Stripes, then Progressive coverall) since
  each pattern uses its own reel type via REEL_SYMS[pat.reel].
- Cache bust: spbm-v567

### v5.68 — Pacing & Card Highlight Improvements
- Bingo card now highlights each pattern's winning cells AND shows its name
  in the pattern-name display during Red Spin (was previously silent —
  only the reels/payout updated, card stayed unchanged).
- Entertainment ball-call interval changed from fixed 1.5s to randomized
  3.2-3.5s (slower pace, more time to react to each ball).
- Spin animation lengthened: main reel stop delays 380/620/900ms ->
  600/1000/1450ms; Red Spin reel stop delays 320/520/720ms -> 500/800/1150ms.
- Cache bust: spbm-v568

### v5.69 — Progressive Jackpot Now Truly LAST in Sequence
- Main spin reels no longer forced to 'coverall'. Main reels now always show
  winPatterns[0] (lowest-pay pattern, e.g. Open Diamond) — Progressive plays
  during Red Spin as the FINAL entry instead.
- runRS extended: when it reaches an isProgressive pattern (now always last),
  its 'coverall' reel symbols land, then showProgJP fires directly as the
  grand finale — no separate Progressive overlay before Red Spin anymore.
- Fixed double-counting: bonusTotal was being added to S.bal twice (once
  per-pattern during the loop, once again at the progressive finale).
- Safeguard: if no other pattern won (winPatterns[0] is itself Progressive),
  it's appended to the Red Spin sequence so showProgJP still fires.
- Correct order end-to-end: Open Diamond -> ... -> Corporal Stripes ->
  Progressive Jackpot (finale) -> sequence ends.
- Cache bust: spbm-v569

### v5.70 — Lazy-T Pattern + Progressive Symbol on Reel Strips (Bonanza Bingo)
- NEW dedicated Progressive trigger pattern "Lazy-T" replaces the old
  all-25-cells "Progressive Jackpot" entry. Cells = O column (4,9,14,19,24)
  + N/middle row (10,11,12,13,14) = 9 cells, matching Bonanza Bingo Lazy-T
  shape. reel:'coverall' (7-7-7), isProgressive:true, pay:[0,0,0].
- A Cover-All-25 card (from generateCoverAllSpin) satisfies Lazy-T
  automatically (9 cells are a subset of all-25) alongside Cover All 40/75
  and the ~20 paytable patterns — all stack as before.
- Symbol 7 (Progressive mascot) added to all 3 reel strips — now appears
  7 times per 50-symbol reel, evenly distributed alongside symbols 0-5.
  Previously symbol 7 existed only as an artificially-inserted result for
  forced 7-7-7 spins, never as a real spinning symbol.
- forcedSpinResult: for any NON-Lazy-T winning pattern that uses symbol 0
  (Scott) as a wild, each wild slot now randomly shows Scott(0) or
  Progressive(7) (50/50, shuffled per spin) — e.g. Tee can show
  Progressive+1Bar+1Bar, Hopscotch can show Progressive+Cherry+blank, etc.
  Lazy-T's fixed 7-7-7 is left untouched (not a substitution).
- Renamed 'Progressive Jackpot' -> 'Lazy-T' throughout (game.js _forcePat
  objects, progressive.js fallback pattern names).
- Cache bust: spbm-v570

### v5.71 — CRITICAL: Lazy-T Finale Never Reached (2 Bugs Fixed)
Root cause of "Lazy-T never awarded, sequence ended on Corporal Stripes,
wrong celebration amount, pot didn't reset visually":

Bug 1 — basePat selection: Cover All 40/75 (pay $0.01/$0, reel:null) were
included in the ascending-pay sort and landed at winPatterns[0] (lowest
pay), becoming basePat. Main reels then showed a no-win 'none' combo
(REEL_SYMS[null] fallback) instead of Open Diamond.
Fix: Cover All 40/75 are now pulled into a separate _sideAwards array,
excluded from basePat/Red-Spin-sequence selection entirely, but still
appended to winPatterns so the penny-toast scan in _finishProgressiveSpin
still finds them.

Bug 2 — runRS's Corporal Stripes ('jp' reel) branch called onDone()
directly after its $800 celebration, ending the ENTIRE Red Spin sequence
early. Since Lazy-T sorts after Corporal Stripes (appended last as the
progressive finale), it never played — sequence stopped at Corporal
Stripes, whose own "$800 JACKPOT" overlay was mistaken for the progressive
celebration (wrong amount, pot never visually updated).
Fix: 'jp' branch now calls playNext() to continue the sequence, so
Lazy-T (or anything else after Corporal Stripes) still plays and
showProgJP fires as the true finale.

Correct order restored: Open Diamond (main reels) -> ... -> Corporal
Stripes ($800 celebration) -> Lazy-T (Progressive finale, showProgJP) ->
sequence ends. Cover All 40/75 awarded silently via penny-toast, unaffected
by reel ordering.
Cache bust: spbm-v571

### v5.72 — Single Combined Celebration (Corporal Stripes + Lazy-T)
Per Sasha's feedback on v5.71 test: when BOTH Corporal Stripes AND Lazy-T
win in the same spin, only ONE final celebration should show.

- runRS's 'jp' branch (Corporal Stripes) now checks progCtx:
  - If progCtx is set (Lazy-T also winning this spin): SKIP Corporal
    Stripes' own "$X JACKPOT" popup entirely. Silently add its pay to
    bonusTotal/S.bal and continue to the next entry. Lazy-T's showProgJP
    becomes the SINGLE finale, with Corporal Stripes' amount folded into
    the total (already added to the accumulative win via _allPatsBonus +
    bonusTotal -> Lazy-T's totalAmt).
  - If progCtx is null (no Lazy-T this spin): Corporal Stripes plays its
    own "$X JACKPOT" Congratulations celebration as the spin's finale,
    as before.

Result: exactly one celebration overlay per spin, regardless of whether
Corporal Stripes, Lazy-T, or both win. Progressive amount is always part
of the single accumulative total shown.

### v5.73 — Pattern Name Position + Pot Reset Fix
- #bingo-pattern-name moved from full-width (above both card AND ball strip)
  to sit ONLY above the bingo card column (first child of #bingo-card-wrap).
  Font size/letter-spacing reduced (13px/3px -> 10px/1px) to fit the
  narrower card-width column, with ellipsis overflow for long pattern names.
- armAndClaim's !_connected/!_client fallback path now resets _localValue
  to _seed (and notifies listeners) after paying out — previously the pot
  meter stayed stuck at the pre-win value when this offline/disconnected
  path fired (likely related to the ongoing Realtime/0-players issue).
  Server-side DB reset still requires a working connection, but the
  player's own display is now consistent.
- Cache bust: spbm-v573

### v5.74 — Pot Reset Diagnostic + Player Nickname Fix
- _claimForceWin's progressive_hit RPC call (the server-side pot reset for
  Force Jackpot wins) NEVER checked rpcRes.error. Supabase RPC failures
  resolve with {error:...} rather than rejecting the promise, so a failed
  reset was silently treated as success — the winning player's LOCAL
  display reset to seed (false success), while the DB pot was never
  actually reset, explaining why other players/operator never saw a
  reset and why the player's own display reverted on the next refresh.
  Now logs a console.warn with the actual error message if this RPC fails
  — needed to diagnose root cause server-side (likely RPC permissions or
  signature mismatch in Supabase).
- Fixed progressive_hits insert: player_label now uses _playerNickname
  (player's chosen name) instead of the generic auto-assigned "Player N"
  label, for both Force Jackpot and natural hit records. Hit History will
  now show the player's actual nickname.
